# Introduction

- Survival analysis is at the core of epidemiological data analysis. 

- The Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) regression model is (still the most) popular model. 

    -  because of its familiarity and convenience

- Recently, there has been increased interest on applications of survival analysis based on Bayesian methodology.

class: middle

# Objectives

- To try and use a parametric Bayesian Survival Model approach and compare with the traditional PH model. 

- The null hypothesis is: the risk of mortality from stroke is the same for people with different milk intake habits.

---
class: middle 

# Data for analysis

- The JACC study data: 

    - 110585 participants (46395 men and 64190 women) aged between 40-79 at baseline

# Exclusion criteria

.med[
1. With stroke history: n = 1496 (915 men and 581 wmen);
2. With cancer history: n = 1461 (411 men and 1050 women);
3. With myocardial infarction history: n = 2994 (1310 men and 1684 women);
4. With ischemic heart diseases history: n = 186 (91 men, 95 women);
5. With other heart diseases history (ICD9 codes: 420-429):  n = 518 (204 men and 314 women);
6. Did not answer the question about milk intake frequency: n = 9545 (3593 men and 5952 women); 
7. Finally, n = 94385 (39386 men and 54999 women) are left in the data

1. Total stroke: <br> only daily drinkers in men had somewhat lower hazard ratio (0.87, 95%CI: 0.76, 1.01)

2. Hemorrhagic stroke: <br> no apparent association for men/women

3. Ischemic stroke: <br> men had milk intake more than 1-2 t/w had **"significantly"** lower hazard compared with non-drinkers

## Interpretation of the P value: 

- The earth is round  (p < 0.05).


.pull-left[
```{r p1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pvalueyay.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r p2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '95%', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pvalue.png")
```
]

???
The p-value is the probability of the observed outcome plus all “more extreme” outcomes under the assumption that the experiment can be repeated for infinite times.

## Assumptions: 

1. The experiment can be repeated.

2. There is a true value of interest (HR) that does not move.

Both are **unrealistic** for a huge cohort study like the JACC study, and may not help in answering the question that we are really interested in.

---
class: middle

## The real research questions are: 

- What is **the probability** that people who drink milk everyday (or other frequency) had lower hazard of dying from stroke compared with people who don't ?

- If someone does not understand the concept of "hazard", then, the question should be changed into: <br> do people drink milk everyday (or other frequency) have **longer survival time/slower rate of dying** that is free from stroke mortality risk?

class: middle

## Bayesian parametric survival model can help us:


- Weibull model is useful because it can be expressed as both
    - accelerated failure time (AFT) model 
    - proportional hazard model

(details skipped, please refer to the handout.)

### Codes for the crude Weibull survival model

We use the [**BUGS**](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/) (**B**ayesian inference **U**sing **G**ibbs **S**ampling) language to describe the model:

.small[
```r
jacc.weibull.model <- function() {
  for(i in 1:39386){# loop through the male subjects
*    is.censored[i] ~ dinterval(t[i], c[i])
    t[i] ~ dweib(shape, lambda[i])
    lambda[i] <- exp(-mu[i] * shape)
*    mu[i] <- beta[1] + beta[2] * equals(Mlkfre[i], 2) +
*      beta[3] * equals(Mlkfre[i], 3) + 
*      beta[4] * equals(Mlkfre[i], 4) +
*      beta[5] * equals(Mlkfre[i], 5) 
  }
```
]

class: middle

### Specify the priors, and generate values

.small[
```r
  ## priors for betas
  for(j in 1:5){
    beta[j] ~ dnorm(0, 0.001)
  } # increase the number here when adding covariates
  
  ### prior for shape
  shape ~ dgamma(.001, .001)
  
  ### Generated values
*  AFT[2] <- exp(beta[2])
*  HR[2] <- exp(shape * beta[2])
*  p.crit[2] <- step(1 - HR[2]) # = 1 if HR[2] < 1
  
  AFT[3] <- exp(beta[3])
  HR[3] <- exp(shape * beta[3])
  p.crit[3] <- step(1 - HR[3])
  
  AFT[4] <- exp(beta[4])
  HR[4] <- exp(shape * beta[4])
  p.crit[4] <- step(1 - HR[4])
  
  AFT[5] <- exp(beta[5])
  HR[5] <- exp(shape * beta[5])
  p.crit[5] <- step(1 - HR[5])
```
]

class: middle

### Run the model (the crude one took me about 1 hours...)

.small[
```r
library(R2jags) #conect to jags sampling engine in R
jagsfit <- jags.parallel(
                   data = JACCdata,
                   parameters.to.save = 
                              c("beta[5]", "HR[5]", "AFT[5]"),
                   #add more variables if you want to check more
*                   n.iter = 10000, 
*                   n.burnin = 2500, 
*                   n.chains = 3,
                   model.file = jacc.weibull.model)
