# Introduction

- Survival analysis is at the core of epidemiological data analysis. 

- The Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) regression model is (still the most) popular model. 

    -  because of its familiarity and convenience

- Recently, there has been increased interest on applications of survival analysis based on Bayesian methodology.

# Objectives

- To try and use a parametric Bayesian Survival Model approach and compare with the traditional PH model. 

- The null hypothesis is: the risk of mortality from stroke is the same for people with different milk intake habits.

# Data for analysis

- The JACC study data: 

    - 110585 participants (46395 men and 64190 women) aged between 40-79 at baseline

# Exclusion criteria

.med[
1. With stroke history: n = 1496 (915 men and 581 wmen);
2. With cancer history: n = 1461 (411 men and 1050 women);
3. With myocardial infarction history: n = 2994 (1310 men and 1684 women);
4. With ischemic heart diseases history: n = 186 (91 men, 95 women);
5. With other heart diseases history (ICD9 codes: 420-429):  n = 518 (204 men and 314 women);
6. Did not answer the question about milk intake frequency: n = 9545 (3593 men and 5952 women); 
7. Finally, n = 94385 (39386 men and 54999 women) are left in the data

# Traditional PH model results

(please see the handout Table 3)

.med[
1. Total stroke: <br> only daily drinkers in men had somewhat lower hazard ratio (0.87, 95%CI: 0.76, 1.01)

2. Hemorrhagic stroke: <br> no apparent association for men/women

3. Ischemic stroke: <br> men had milk intake more than 1-2 t/w had **"significantly"** lower hazard compared with non-drinkers

## Interpretation of the P value: 

- The earth is round  (p < 0.05).


.pull-left[
```{r p1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pvalueyay.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r p2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '95%', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pvalue.png")
```
]

???
The p-value is the probability of the observed outcome plus all “more extreme” outcomes under the assumption that the experiment can be repeated for infinite times.

## Assumptions: 

1. The experiment can be repeated.

2. There is a true value of interest (HR) that does not move.

Both are **unrealistic** for a huge cohort study like the JACC study, and may not help in answering the question that we are really interested in.

## The real research questions are: 

- What is **the probability** that people who drink milk everyday (or other frequency) had lower hazard of dying from stroke compared with people who don't ?

- If someone does not understand the concept of "hazard", then, the question should be changed into: <br> do people drink milk everyday (or other frequency) have **longer survival time/slower rate of dying** that is free from stroke mortality risk?

## Bayesian parametric survival model can help us:


- Weibull model is useful because it can be expressed as both
    - accelerated failure time (AFT) model 
    - proportional hazard model

(details skipped, please refer to the handout.)

# Merits and demerits

- It generates conclusion based on the synthesis of new information from an observed data and historical knowledge or expert opinion.

- Therefore, Bayesian survival analysis reflects researches subjective beliefs.
